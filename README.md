### “The goal is to turn data into information and information into insight.” – Carly Florina

I am enthusiastic about Data Science considering how it can be used to build actionable solutions. There is so much to do with the data and I find all of this very exciting having witnessed how data can be used to make a positive impact. I have two years of experience in the field of Analytics & Machine Learning tackling day-to-day and strategic business challenges. As an experienced Analyst, I am well versed in gathering business requirements, managing the data, building forecasting models, creating automated dashboards, and visualizations to dive deep into complex issues. I am passionate about furthering my data analysis practices to support strategic decision-making processes.
